/**
 * Filters all episodes currently in the Zustand store and returns an array of
 * all matches.
 *
 * If the `episodes` property in the store is `undefined` it means that no
 * episodes have been retrieved from the server yet. In that case the hook will
 * simply return `null` and fire a request to the server to retrieve the
 * episodes. Once the episodes have been retrieved hook should reactively update
 * the components that consume it.
 *
 * Note that it is possible that some episodes might have already been retrieved
 * from the server, but that no episodes for the specific queried show have been
 * retrieved yet. In this case `null` will be returned and the required HTTP
 * request will be sent.
 *
 * The hook exposes three properties:
 *
 * - `result` - The array of `episodes` that match the query, or temporarily
 *   `null` if the data is still being retrieved from the server. If no queries
 *   match the query then an empty array will be returned.
 *
 * - `query` - The current query object that determines which episodes are
 *   returned by `result`. Returning the actual `query` object itself is useful
 *   if you want to display the active query in some manner to the user.
 *
 * - `changeQuery` - A function that changes the current query. Note that it
 *   automatically merges the new query with the existing one. This means that
 *   you only need to supply the properties you want to update, and it will be
 *   combined with the existing query. If the newly provided query matches the
 *   existing query nothing will happen. Otherwise, both `query`, and
 *   subsequently `result`, will be updated.
 *
 * @param {object} [initial] - The starting query that will be called when the
 * hook is initialised. If you do not pass a value, then the hook will wait
 * until `changeQuery` is manually called instead.
