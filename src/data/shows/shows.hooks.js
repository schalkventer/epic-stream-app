/**
 * Filters all shows currently in the Zustand store and returns an array of
 * all matches.
 *
 * If the `shows` property in the store is `undefined` it means that no shows
 * have been retrieved from the server yet. In that case the hook will simply
 * return `null` and fire a request to the server to retrieve the shows. Once
 * the shows have been retrieved hook should reactively update the components
 * that consume it.
 *
 * The hook exposes three properties:
 *
 * - `result` - The array of `shows` that match the query, or temporarily `null`
 *   if the data is still being retrieved from the server. If no shows match the
 *   query then an empty array will be returned.
 *
 * - `query` - The current query object that determines which shows are returned
 *   by `result`. Returning the actual `query` object itself is useful if you
 *   want to display the active query in some manner to the user.
 *
 * - `changeQuery` - A function that changes the current query. Note that it
 *   automatically merges the new query with the existing one. This means that
 *   you only need to supply the properties you want to update, and it will be
 *   combined with the existing query. If the newly provided query matches the
 *   existing query nothing will happen. Otherwise, both `query`, and
 *   subsequently `result`, will be updated.
 *
 * @param {object} [initial] - The starting query that will be called
 * when the hook is initialised. If you do not pass a value, then the hook will
 * wait until `changeQuery` is manually called instead.
