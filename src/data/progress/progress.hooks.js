 * the progress property in the Zustand store. It is primarily used to retrieved
 * any previous saved progress key-value pairs. However, it can also be used to
 * set/update the progress key-value pairs. Alternatively it can also be used to
 * reset all recorded progress to zero by means of `clear`.
 *
 * No state should be stored in this hook, and subsequently, the output of the
 * hook is memoized to prevent accidental re-render (if state is accidentally
 * added). This means that the object returned by the hook will never break
 * referential equality in React.
 *
 * Note that all these methods return the new state of the `progress` object
 * after their mutation.

 *
 * - `result` - the progress of the episode (as a number)
 * - `query` - the current query (as as a string)
 * - `change` - a function to update the query (and subsequently the `result`)
